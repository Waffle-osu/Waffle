i have little motivation to work on waffle anymore. ever since discovering that titanic exists i kinda felt like i missed the deadline. 
anything i do will just be worthless as i wont have a bancho that anyone will play on. making half the things i plan on implementing pointless without a playerbase.
shit like serverside tournament clients for clients that dont have one, all the PP systems in the world, all the statistics potential, all of it doesnt matter.
it needs a playerbase and titanic existing eliminates this. there's no point in waffle existing, any idea i have will just be eaten by the competition, there's no point in going further.
